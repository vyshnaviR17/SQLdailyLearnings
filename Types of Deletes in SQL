There are 3 types of DELETEs in SQL.
(1)DELETE: With the help of DELETE we can delete one or more records in a table.We can't delete columns or tables with DELETE command.
SYNTAX: DELETE FROM <TABLENAME>; (this query empties the table)
Or We can specify some condition in the where clause for specific deletion of reocrds
        DELETE FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE <CONDIITON>;
(2)DROP: With the help of DROP we can delete columns or a whole table itself including column or table's data.Complete table structure will be deleted(helps in 
freeing up the space).We cant delete reocrds individually.
SYNTAX: For dropping a table =  DROP TABLE <TABLENAME>;
        For dropping a column = ALTER TABLE <TABLENAME> DROP COLUMN <COLUMNNAME>;
(3)TRUNCATE: With the help of TRUNCATE we can delete all of the table's data, but the structure will be preserved.
SYNTAX: TRUNCATE TABLE <TABLENAME>;


DELETE vs TRUNCATE
(*)DELETE is a Data Manipulation Language command. TRUNCATE is a Data Definition Language command.
(*)DELETE command doesn't free up the space IMMEDIATELY and is relatively slower compared to TRUNCATE command. It is because the DELETE command deletes the rows and
it will write the data at row level into transaction log. While TRUNCATE command deletes records page by page and makes it faster in freeing up the space.
